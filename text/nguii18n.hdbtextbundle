HELP_EXP_IDEA_MODIFY=<h2>Create/Modify an Idea</h2><h3>Campaign</h3><p>Campaigns are used to collect ideas for a particular focus area. The campaign defines the phases of the innovation process that an idea may go through. &nbsp;</p><h3>Title</h3><p>The title is the first and often the only information that other participants get about your idea. It is shown on the front of the idea card.</p><p>While you are typing in the idea title, a list of similar ideas begins populating. You can explore any of these ideas to see their details.</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Describe your idea so that readers understand it easily. The first few sentences of your description are automatically displayed on the back of the idea card, so try to put as much information as possible into them, or start the description with a kind of abstract. If it helps to explain your idea, embed images or upload further files as attachments.</p><h3>Title Image and Attachments</h3><p>As soon as you enter the title of your idea, a graphical title image for your idea card is created automatically from the text. Upload a title image to replace this image and make your idea card easily recognizable. You can upload attachments in many common file formats to explain your idea in more detail.</p><h3>Responsibility List</h3><p>If your campaign is assigned to a responsibility list, a dropdown is displayed where you can select the relevant value for the idea. Based on the selected value the system automatically assigns pre-defined idea coaches and experts to the idea.</p><h3>Links</h3><p>Use links to refer to websites or other resources addressable via an URL. Optionally, you can define a meaningful label, which is displayed instead of the URL.</p><h3>Coauthors</h3><p>Coauthors are people who have contributed significantly to your idea.</p><h3>Tags</h3><p>Tags are useful for finding ideas on specific topics. To add a tag to your idea, start typing to select an existing tag or enter a new one.</p><h3>Walls</h3><p>Walls can be added to an idea at the time of its creation. If you click on the button, a window with the wall list will pop up and you can choose the wall you want to attach</p><h3>Contribution Share</h3><p>If rewards are enabled for your campaign and this idea has more than one author, you have to specify the contribution share in the given input field so as to display the input contribution share for each author. The total should be always 100%.</p><p>Campaign managers consider this contribution share while creating rewards for ideas.</p><h3>Custom Fields</h3><p>If a custom idea form is assigned to your campaign, additional fields are displayed below the description for you to enter the respective values.</p><h3>Open for Contributors</h3><p>If this checkbox is selected, a handshake icon shows up on the idea card to indicate to community users that the submitter of the idea is looking for users who can contribute to the idea creation and processing.</p><h3>Saving Your Idea</h3><p>If you save your idea as draft, it is only visible to you. You can open it later in&nbsp;<em>My Ideas</em>&nbsp;and edit or submit it. If you submit your idea, it becomes visible in the idea community. An idea coach is assigned to take it through the phases of the innovation process.</p><h3>More Information</h3><p>For more information, see <a href="http://help.sap.com/inm">http://help.sap.com/inm</a> -&gt; <em>Application Help</em> -&gt; <em>Idea Community</em> -&gt; <em>Creating an Idea</em></p>
